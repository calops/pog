# What is pog?

Pog is a powerful [Nix](https://nixos.org/) library that transforms the way developers create [command-line interfaces (CLIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). At its core, pog is a sophisticated tool that leverages the declarative nature of Nix to generate feature-rich bash scripts with comprehensive CLI capabilities. It serves as a bridge between Nix's powerful package management and the practical needs of command-line tool development.

## What does it enable?

Pog enables developers to create professional-grade CLI tools without the traditional overhead of building command-line applications from scratch. It provides a declarative approach to defining CLI tools, where developers can specify flags, documentation, completion behavior, and runtime dependencies all within a single Nix expression. The library handles the complex underlying mechanics of bash script generation, including argument parsing, help text generation, and terminal interaction features.

Some key capabilities that pog enables include:

- Creation of self-documenting CLI tools with automatic help text generation
- Implementation of rich flag systems with short and long options
- Integration of interactive prompts and color-coded output
- Tab completion functionality out of the box
- Required flags, and the option to provide interactive prompts for them
- Environment variable override support
- Strict mode operation for enhanced reliability
- Integration with the broader Nix ecosystem

## Why use pog?

The primary benefit of using pog lies in its ability to combine the reproducibility of Nix with the practical needs of CLI tool development. Here's why pog stands out:

1. **Reproducibility**: Being built on Nix, pog inherits all the benefits of Nix's reproducible builds. Every CLI tool created with pog is guaranteed to have the same behavior across different environments, as all dependencies are explicitly declared and managed through Nix.

2. **Declarative Development**: Rather than imperatively writing bash scripts and manually handling argument parsing, help text, and other boilerplate, pog allows developers to declare what they want their CLI tool to do in a clean, maintainable format.

3. **Rich Feature Set**: Pog provides a comprehensive set of features that would typically require multiple libraries or significant development time to implement, including:

   - Advanced flag parsing with type checking
   - Interactive prompts and spinners
   - Color-coded output and styling
   - Tab completion
   - Verbose mode and debugging support

4. **Integration with [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)**: Pog seamlessly integrates with the vast ecosystem of [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs), making it easy to include runtime dependencies and leverage existing tools in your CLI applications.

5. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Common CLI patterns like help text generation, flag parsing, and environment variable handling are automated, reducing the amount of code developers need to write and maintain.

## Why is it called pog?

The name "pog" draws inspiration from the internet slang term "POG" or "PogChamp," which expresses excitement or amazement at something extraordinary. Just as the term represents something impressive or exciting, pog aims to provide an impressive and exciting way to create CLI tools. The name reflects the library's goal of making CLI development not just functional, but genuinely enjoyable and remarkable.

The choice of name also aligns with the library's philosophy of being both powerful and playful â€“ it's a serious tool that doesn't take itself too seriously. Like the cultural phenomenon it references, pog aims to make developers' lives better while maintaining a touch of fun in the often complex world of CLI tool development.
