Pog is a Nix library that enables developers to create feature-rich command-line tools with minimal effort. At its core, it transforms Nix and Bash code into fully-featured CLI applications, complete with flag parsing, auto-documentation, tab completion, and interactive elements.

## What does it enable?

The library abstracts away much of the boilerplate typically required for CLI development, providing a declarative way to specify flags, arguments, and runtime dependencies. It leverages Nix's package management capabilities while offering modern CLI features like colorized output, spinners, and interactive prompts.

## Why is it called pog?

The name "pog" reflects the excitement and joy developers might feel when discovering how easily they can create powerful CLI tools with minimal code - much like the PogChamp emote expresses excitement and joy on Twitch. The library aims to make CLI development an exciting and surprisingly pleasant experience, turning what could be a tedious task into something that makes developers go "Pog!"
